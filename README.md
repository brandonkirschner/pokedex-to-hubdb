# Pokedex to HubDB
#### A script for downloading Pokemon data and uploading them to HubSpot's [HubDB](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tools/hubdb)

## Description
##### A nodejs script that downloads (GETs) Pokemon from the [Pok√©api](https://pokeapi.co/) and uploads (POSTs) them to a HubSpot HubDB table.

## HubDB Requirements
#### This script requires a HubDB table with the following columns (in the order from left to right):
1. Name
2. Number
3. Weight
4. Height
5. Sprite
6. Type 1
7. Type 2

## Instructions
1. Clone repo
2. Create a .env file in the root of the project
3. Open the .env on a code/text editor and add `API_KEY=YOUR-ACTUAL-API-KEY-GOES-HERE`
4. Run `npm install` in the root of the project using a CLI
5. Run `node index.js g` to begin the fetch process. A prompt will begin, asking you for the starting pokemon number and the ending pokemon number (e.g. 1, 150). You will see "Save Completed" in the CLI's console when the pokemon.json file has been updated with the pokemon
6. Run `node index.js s` to begin the send to HubDB process. A prompt will begin, asking for the HubDB's ID. When you enter the HubDB's ID, the script will begin sending (POST) the pokemon to the specified HubDB.
